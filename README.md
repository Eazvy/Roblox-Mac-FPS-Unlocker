# Roblox FPS Unlocker for MacOS
# When Roblox updates you have to run this again
# To clear some confusion: 
# Ban-Wave was occurring for memory-writes, meaning actual modification to Roblox while this is simply editing flags that are readily available to all users. Roblox staff cleared that you will not get banned for modifying flags, as said in the forum post. It was just a precaution to temporarily remove all files as a safety measure to ensure all accounts remain safe. Itâ€™s been about 4-5 days since and we are clear to continue to use flags but use this with caution as Roblox can change their decision at any given time.
# dm @omaw for any problems
